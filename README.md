# 🚗 A Machine Learning Based Approach for CO₂ Emission Rating of Vehicles Using Data Science

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and rating the CO₂ emissions of new light-duty vehicles using **machine learning** and **data science**. It leverages Python and the **Random Forest Classifier** to predict vehicle emission levels and provide eco-friendly ratings such as *Good*, *Average*, or *Bad*.  

The project aims to help both consumers and policymakers make better decisions to promote cleaner transportation and reduce environmental pollution.

The project, **"A Machine Learning Based Approach for CO₂ Emission Rating of Vehicles Using Data Science"**, analyzes vehicle emission data from Canadian light-duty vehicles (2022).  
It applies the **Random Forest Classifier** to predict and rate vehicles based on their emission levels.  
This provides valuable insights for consumers and policymakers to encourage the use of low-emission vehicles, helping reduce pollution and protect the environment.
